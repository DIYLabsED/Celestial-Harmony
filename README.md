# Celestial-Harmony
Official GitHub page to download the Celestial Harmony planet pack and its updates.

Celestial Harmony is a system replacer for KSP, featuring a brand new star system. Will later feature an additional system.
This planet pack is set in the far future where kerbals have migrated towards a luxurious binary habitable worlds.

Since this is a system replacer, it is NOT compatible with other system replacers such as JNSQ, Beyond Home, Homeswitches, etc...
As well as other visual mods, Celestial Harmony has its own visuals.
KSC Switcher is also an incompatibility.
